# 🎓 College Database Project (Version 1.2)

This project defines a relational database schema for managing a college's academic system using **MySQL**. It includes support for students, faculty, staff, courses, departments, enrollment, grades, rooms, and semesters.

Designed for use with **MySQL Workbench EER Diagrams**, this schema enforces key **relational constraints** and supports **normalized data** suitable for reporting and extensions.

## 🔐 Constraints & Notes

* ✅ All foreign keys use `ON DELETE RESTRICT` by default.
* ✅ Room capacity is enforced via a `CHECK (capacity > 0)` constraint.
* 🎓 Only `student_id` from the `Student` table can enroll in courses.
* 🎓 Only `faculty_id` from the `Faculty` table can teach courses.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open **MySQL Workbench**
2. Create a new schema/database
3. Run the contents of `schema.sql`
4. Optionally, run `sample_data.sql` to preload the database
5. (Optional) Use `college_eer.mwb` to view or edit the EER diagram visually

## 📈 Future Enhancements (Version 2+)

* ✅ Triggers to enforce role-based logic (students vs faculty)
* ✅ Room booking constraints by time slots
* ✅ Prerequisite relationships between courses
* ✅ Attendance and assignment tracking
* ✅ Stored procedures and views
